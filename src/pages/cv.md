## Education

I have a BSc in Mathematics (1st) from the University of Reading 

## Sabbatical

In 2019 I took a sabbatical which I used to tour Europe's best rock climbing destinations.

Since I couldn't climb _every_ day I kept my skills sharp with a couple of projects:

- [FIA](https://figureit.app): A mobile app to help you deal with timezones (keeping in touch with international friends is tricky!)
- Dice words with friends (unpublished): I built a multi-player [boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) clone in a particularly rainy weekend (I did not win the boggle tournament) 
- [reason-standard](https://github.com/dean177/reason-standard): A portable and safe standard library enhancement for ReasonML & Ocaml. Now merged with Tablecloth.
- [expo-leaflet](https://github.com/Dean177/expo-leaflet/blob/master/expo-leaflet/readme.md): A cross platform (web & mobile) library for interacting with maps
- [Chroma climbing](https://chromaclimbing.com): Developed the inital prototype.
